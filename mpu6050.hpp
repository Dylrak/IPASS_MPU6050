/// \brief
/// library for mpu6050
/// \details
/// Library for the MPU 6050 sensor.
/// It contains all I2C-addresses necessary to communicate with the sensor, as well as the acceleration- and gyroscopic values of the sensor.
/// Futhermore, it contains functions to update said values, along with functions to calculate the pitch and roll based on said values.
/// Limitations:
/// -The MPU 6050 is installed 'sideways' on my breadboard, so the notions of 'pitch' and 'roll' are calculated differently than expected.
/// -The update rate is bound to that of the i2c_bus_bit_banged_scl_sda, so although the sensor could easily update at 400 kHz it will actually be somewhere below 100 kHz.
